// 3.	First and Last K Numbers
// Write a function that prints the first k and the last k elements from an array of numbers.
// The input comes as an array of number elements. The first element represents the number k,
// all other elements are from the array that needs to be processed.
// The output is printed on the console on two lines. On the first line, print the first k elements,
// separated by space. On the second line, print the last k elements, separated by space.

  console.log(arr.slice(0, n).join(" "));
  console.log(arr.slice(-n).join(" "));
