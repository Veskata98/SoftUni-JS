// 6.	Make a Dictionary
// You will receive an array with strings in the form of JSON's.
// You have to parse these strings and combine them into one object.
// Every string from the array will hold terms and a description.
// If you receive the same term twice, replace it with the new definition.
// Print every term and definition in that dictionary on new line in format:
// `Term: ${term} => Definition: ${definition}`
// Don't forget to sort the dictionary alphabetically by the terms as in real dictionaries.
